## Team
Mustapha Ramadan : I will work alone in all stages of project completion

## Technologies Used
[Laravel 9.X](https://laravel.com/) - PHP framework.
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JavaScript framework for the frontend.
[BootStrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) - css & js framework for the frontend.

In this project, I will use the PHP programming language and the Laravel framework, as well as JavaScript and html and CSS.
I chose to use PHP and its Laravel software framework, because it is very easy and smooth to deal with, and also because I have already completed projects with it before.
